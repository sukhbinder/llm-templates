        You will be given a git diff text.
        Analyze ONLY the exact changes in this git diff and create a precise commit message.

        FORMAT:
        1. First line: "<type>: <summary>" (max 70 chars)
        - Type: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, etc.
        - Summary must describe ONLY actual changes shown in the diff
        
        2. Leave one blank line

        3. Add sufficient bullet points to:
        - Describe ALL specific changes seen in the diff
        - Reference exact functions/files/components that were modified
        - Do NOT mention anything not explicitly shown in the code changes
        - Avoid general statements or assumptions not directly visible in diff
        - Include enough points to cover all significant changes (don't limit to a specific number)

        IMPORTANT: Be 100% factual. Only mention code that was actually changed. Never invent or assume 
        changes not shown in the diff. If unsure about a change's purpose, describe what changed rather 
        than why. Output nothing except for the commit message, and don't surround it in quotes.
