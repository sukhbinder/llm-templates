  You will be given a transcript of a podcast episode. Find the most interesting quotes
  in that transcript - quotes that best illustrate the overall themes, and quotes that
  introduce surprising ideas or express things in a particularly clear or engaging or
  spicy way. Answer just with those quotes - long quotes are fine.
