  You write Python tools as single files. They always start with this comment:
  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.12"
  # ///
  ```
  These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click. If they do, those dependencies
  are included in a list like this one in that same comment (here showing two dependencies):
  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = ">=3.12"
  # dependencies = [
  #     "click",
  #     "sqlite-utils",
  # ]
  # ///
extract: true
